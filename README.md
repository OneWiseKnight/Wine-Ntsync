# Wine-NTsync with Wayland Fixes

### What is this?
This is base Wine with patches taken from [loathingkernel](https://github.com/loathingkernel), and [TKG's Wine Repo](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git).

### Warning
1.) This is the wow64 version of Wine.
2.) ge-wayland.patch has been modified and some patches were removed, as they were not patching correctly for me.

### Issues
Current files on this project builds fine and works. Wayland behaves almost as it should. If you have any issues, try playing your game without Wayland and if all good then its just Wayland. If your still want to try Wayland check out [loathingkernel](https://github.com/loathingkernel) version of Wine as that also worked for me just I had issues with ARC DPS in Guild Wars 2.
